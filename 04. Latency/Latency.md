(Verse 1)
You found me online, we fell through the screen,
Long distance made us dreamers, built something unseen.
You moved across the country just to be here with me,
We’re finally in the same room — supposed to be free.

(Pre-Chorus)
You’re everything I wanted, I swear it’s true,
I’m giving you all of me, all of me to you.

(Chorus)
Latency,
We’re waiting for the game to load,
Trying to sync, trying to find our code.
Latency,
There’s a moment between your heart and mine,
We’re close, but we don’t align.

(Verse 2)
You kiss me and I feel it a second too late,
We’re dancing but we’re dancing to a different fate.
You say the words I’ve always wanted to hear,
But they arrive like echoes — delayed and unclear.

(Pre-Chorus)
You’re pouring out your love like water in my hands,
But I’m watching it slip through like I don’t understand.

(Chorus)
Latency,
We’re waiting for the game to load,
Trying to sync, trying to find our code.
Latency,
There’s a moment between your heart and mine,
We’re close, but we don’t align.

(Verse 3)
Maybe it’s me that’s broken, maybe I can’t feel,
Maybe loving you should hurt, but it just feels unreal.
You’re perfect on the surface, but we don’t click inside,
We’re running different systems — no matter how we try.

(Bridge)
So we stay here together in this buffered embrace,
You love me, I love you, but we’re in different places.
I’m sorry that I can’t receive what you’re sending,
I’m sorry that this love has no happy ending.

(Chorus)
Latency,
We’re waiting for the game to load,
Trying to sync, trying to find our code.
Latency,
There’s a moment between your heart and mine,
We’re close, but we don’t align.

(Outro)
Latency.
We’re so close, but we’re so far away.
Latency.
We’re so close, but we’re so far away.
