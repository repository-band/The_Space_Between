(Intro)
One major study tracking children into young adulthood found that father absence in childhood was associated with higher depressive symptoms in adolescence and early adulthood.

A big part of the story is emotional security – what psychologists call attachment. When a child’s close relationships feel unreliable or inconsistent, that can shape how they handle closeness later on: trust, self-worth, and the sense that relationships are safe.￼

Research also connects anxious attachment to rejection sensitivity – basically, being on high alert for signs you’re about to be pushed away.

(Verse 1)
The screen goes dark in a quiet room,
boxes breathing dust against the wall.
Half a life hanging in the air,
filling up with words I never said.

(Verse 2)
Amber running down my throat,
uncried tears in the space between.
All the versions I tried to be
drowning in the skin I'm in.

(Chorus)
System halt, this build is done.
Staying on as I come undone.

(Verse 3)
I'm burning down quiet, ember to ash,
like a cigarette left to itself.
Sinking slow in a room of my own making,
nothing but the smoke of who I was left.

(Chorus)
System halt, this build is done.
Staying on as I come undone.

(Bridge)
Going under. Burning out.
System failing. All lights out.

(Chorus)
System halt, this build is done.
Staying on as I come undone.

(Outro)
The cursor stops its blinking,
the progress bar goes still.
This version sinks in silence,
as the space between is filled.
