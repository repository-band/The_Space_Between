(Verse 1)
An empty canvas screaming for my touch,
I’m so alive inside the code.
Building worlds from nothing,
to prove I’m more than a ghost.
More than a ghost.

(Chorus)
Watch me render my intentions,
Frame by frame, I come alive.
Every pixel a redemption
I become what I design.
I become what I design.

(Verse 2)
Minds burning, trading fire,
Building through the endless night.
The work becomes my answer,
as it devours me alive.

(Chorus)
Watch me render my intentions,
Frame by frame, I come alive.
Every pixel a redemption
I become what I design.
I become what I design.

(Bridge)
I’ll engineer my own ascent,
and chase it till I break.
Every step a small salvation,
Proof that I’m awake.

(Chorus)
Watch me render my intentions,
Frame by frame, I come alive.
Every pixel a redemption
I become what I design.
I become what I design.

(Outro)
In every line,
I’m redefined.
Redefined.
Redefined.
