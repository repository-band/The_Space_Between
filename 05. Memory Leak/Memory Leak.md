(Verse 1)
There’s a black hole where my heart should be,
Everything you give just disappears in me.
I pour myself into the void,
Watch me vanish like a paranoid.

(Pre-Chorus)
I’m bleeding out but nothing fills,
rewriting scripts but lacking skills.

(Chorus)
Memory leak, a black hole in my chest,
I give and give into the emptiness.
Memory leak, am I enough for you?
I give and give, I’m disappearing too.

(Verse 2)
There’s a weight collapsing my center,
Every thought dissolves into the fall.
My own gravity pulls me under,
Leaking into nothing, swallowing it all.

(Pre-Chorus)
I’m pouring out but running dry,
The more I give, the more I die.

(Chorus)
Memory leak, a black hole in my chest,
I give and give into the emptiness.
Memory leak, am I enough for you?
I give and give, I’m disappearing too.

(Bridge)
Maybe I’m not the leak, maybe I’m just hollow,
A crater where a person used to follow.

(Chorus / Outro)
Memory leak, a black hole in my chest,
I give and give into the emptiness.
Memory leak, am I enough for you?
I give and give, I’m disappearing too.
