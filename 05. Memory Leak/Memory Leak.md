(Verse 1)
There’s a black hole where my heart should be,
Everything I give just disappears in me.
I pour myself into the void,
Watch it vanish, was I paranoid?

(Pre-Chorus)
I’m bleeding out but nothing fills,
The hunger never stops, it never will.

(Chorus)
Memory leak, black hole in my chest,
I give and give into the emptiness.
Memory leak, am I enough for you?
I give and give, I’m disappearing too.

(Verse 2)
You hold my hand but I’m already gone,
Dissolving into nothing all along.
I speak the words but they fall inside,
Swallowed by the darker side.

(Pre-Chorus)
I’m pouring out but running dry,
The more I give, the less I try.

(Chorus)
Memory leak, black hole in my chest,
I give and give into the emptiness.
Memory leak, am I enough for you?
I give and give, I’m disappearing too.

(Bridge)
Maybe I’m not the leak, maybe I’m just hollow,
A crater where a person used to follow.

(Chorus / Outro)
Memory leak, black hole in my chest,
I give and give into the emptiness.
Memory leak, am I enough for you?
I give and give, I’m disappearing too.
