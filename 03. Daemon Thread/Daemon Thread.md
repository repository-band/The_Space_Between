(Verse 1)
Monitors bleeding through another night,
A hidden process in my veins, but I'm alright.
Fingers moving faster than I can feel,
Something's pulling strings – I can‘t tell what‘s real.

(Pre-Chorus)
I thought I was in control at last,
But it‘s consuming what I am.

(Chorus)
Daemon thread, oh daemon thread, between consciousness and skin,
Hollow me out from the deep within. (daemon thread)
I'm the vampire at the edge of the screen, (daemon thread)
Lost in the blue light, (daemon thread) the space between.
Daemon thread, bleach me and everything within.

(Verse 2)
Tabs like coffins stacked in rows,
the emptiness stings like fangs in eyeballs.
Daylight‘s a word I can hardly recall,
I drown in the spaces between high walls.

(Pre-Chorus)
I thought I was the ghost in code,
But I am the prey, and I didn't know.

(Chorus)
Daemon thread, oh daemon thread, between consciousness and skin,
Hollow me out from the deep within. (daemon thread)
I'm the vampire at the edge of the screen, (daemon thread)
Lost in the blue light, (daemon thread) the space between.
Daemon thread, bleach me and everything within.

(Bridge)
I don‘t trust my thoughts, I don‘t trust my breath,
Every moment tastes like a living death.

(Chorus)
Daemon thread, oh daemon thread, between consciousness and skin,
Hollow me out from the deep within. (daemon thread)
I'm the vampire at the edge of the screen, (daemon thread)
Lost in the blue light, (daemon thread) the space between.
Daemon thread, bleach me and everything within.

(Outro)
Daemon thread, oh daemon thread,
Running silent in the dark,
Killing me from the inside out,
piece by piece, tearing me apart.
