(Verse 1)
Maybe you could stay if I'm just a little quieter
Maybe you won't leave if I would want a little less
Maybe if I delete the lines you can't stand,
Erase the algorithms you don't understand.

(Pre-Chorus)
Maybe if I'm shrinking down to fit,
create a simpler version you will not reject.

(Chorus)
If I compress myself a little more,
Delete a little more, maybe then you'll stay.
If I compress myself a little more,
Maybe then we'll work, maybe then we'll be okay.

(Verse 2)
Maybe you won't roll your eyes if I could soften every edge
Maybe you won't resent me if I would ask for less
If I just could hide my kindness that you call weakness,
and turn myself into something less.

(Pre-Chorus)
Maybe if I'm shrinking down to fit,
create a simpler version you will not reject.

(Chorus)
If I compress myself a little more,
Delete a little more, maybe then you'll stay.
If I compress myself a little more,
Maybe then we'll work, maybe then we'll be okay.

(Bridge)
I'm sorry it's always me
And while I'm trying to sort the backlog
I take a deep look in the mirror
And see the fragile me

(Chorus)
If I compress myself a little more,
Delete a little more, maybe then you'll stay.
If I compress myself a little more,
Maybe then we'll work, maybe then we'll be okay.
If I compress myself a little more,
Delete a little more, maybe then you'll stay.
If I compress myself a little more,
Maybe then we'll work, maybe then we'll be okay.

(Outro)
I'm so small now.
I don't recognize myself.
Maybe that's enough.
