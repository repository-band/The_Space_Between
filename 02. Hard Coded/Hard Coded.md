(Verse 1)
Circuits humming where my heartbeat should be,
Smile painted on — a default state.
Logic overrides the chaos inside,
I’m learning lines I didn’t write.

(Pre-Chorus)
I’m rewiring what I am,
Erasing edges, filing corners smooth.

(Chorus)
I’m hard coded, hard coded,
Running programs I don’t own.
Every gesture, every word — a loop repeating.
I’m hard coded, hard coded,
Flesh pretending to be stone.
Hard coded, hard coded
Can you see the seams? Can you see me?

(Verse 2)
Repressing static, swallowing screams,
Playing robot in a suit and tie.
Every instinct locked away in dark,
I’m mimicking what humans do.

(Pre-Chorus)
I’m rewiring what I am,
Trading fever for cold precision.

(Chorus)
I’m hard coded, hard coded,
Running programs I don’t own.
Every gesture, every word — a loop repeating.
I’m hard coded, hard coded,
Flesh pretending to be stone.
Hard coded, hard coded
Can you see the seams? Can you see me?

(Bridge)
I was chaos once,
Now I’m just a function.
I was fire once,
Now I’m just a trick.
They don’t know the thing inside,
The thing I buried to survive.

(Outro)
Hard coded.
Hard coded.
I’m still in here.
Hard coded.
Hard coded.
Hard coded.
Hard coded.
Can you see me?
