(Verse 1)
Keep it together, don’t show the cracks,
Smile like you mean it, push it back.
They can’t know you’re drowning,
They can’t see the logs.

(Chorus)
I’m an exception I can’t report!
A critical error I can’t abort!
I'm falling, shattering, going under
I'm still standing, but how much longer?
Please don’t find me, please don’t see.
I'm so ashamed of what’s left of me.

(Verse 2)
Nod and smile, swallow the dark,
Keep the warning lights behind the spark.
One more day, one more performance,
One more hour before I break.

(Pre-Chorus)
One more breath, one more lie,
Just a little longer till I die.

(Chorus)
I’m an exception I can’t report!
A critical error I can’t abort!
I'm falling, shattering, going under
I'm still standing, but how much longer?
Please don’t find me, please don’t see.
I'm so ashamed of what’s left of me.

(Bridge)
I’m so tired of pretending,
I’m so tired of the silence.
I want to leave this all behind,
Let the whole thing crash and burn.

(Chorus)
I’m an exception I can’t report!
A critical error I can’t abort!
I'm falling, shattering, going under
I'm still standing, but how much longer?
Please don’t find me, please don’t see.
I'm so ashamed of what’s left of me.

(Outro)
Keep it together.
Keep it together.
Keep it together.
