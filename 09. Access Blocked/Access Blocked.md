(Verse 1)
This is the life I asked for.
This is the life I got.
Every step was calculated.
Every choice was by the book.

(Chorus)
So why does it feel
like I'm standing in the wrong scene?
Why does it feel
like I'm a specter in the rain?
Why does it feel
like watching myself through the glass?
Why does it feel
like nothing here is real?

(Verse 2)
I did everything they told me.
Optimized, improved, complied.
I became the better version.
Still something's wrong inside.

(Chorus)
So why does it feel
like I'm standing in the wrong scene?
Why does it feel
like I'm a specter in the rain?
Why does it feel
like watching myself through the glass?
Why does it feel
like nothing here is real?
Oh why does it feel
like nothing here is real?
And why does it feel
like I don't belong here?
And why does it feel
Like nothing really matters?
And why does it feel
like I should walk away?

(Outro)
Two futures in the doorway,
my name carved into each frame.
I’m frozen in the hallway,
at a crossroad I can't name.
