(Verse)
You dipped when I was little, never looked back,
switched lanes, cut ties, slid off the main track.
All I got is one scene, one blurry little label –
you bent over the dinner table, fixing my RC cable.
Kindergarten, I swore you were coming to collect me,
sold everybody a dream just to make it feel correct, see?
But you never came through, and I learned that lesson fast –
how to build me a world where the hurt can’t last.
How to stitch up a story when the truth feels lethal,
how to smile in a room full of “normal” people.
How to turn “he left” into “he’s busy, he’ll be here” –
practice makes perfect when your father disappears.

(Hook)
You can’t be close but far away,
hacked into my system to this day.
You can’t be close but far away,
disconnected from myself, cast astray.
You can’t be close but far away,
hacked into my system to this day.
You can’t be close but far away,
look what you did to me, but anyway...

(Verse)
Seventeen, in a band, name printed in the paper,
now you write like “what’s up?” like you weren’t a stranger.
“Wanna meet at the show?” – oh, now you got time?
Funny how you find a clock when the spotlight shines.
We sit down and you drop it like it’s nothing to say,
you’ve been living ten damn minutes away.
Ten minutes – the whole goddamn time you stayed near,
you could’ve knocked any Tuesday, any week, any year.
But you didn’t. You vanished. A coward in plain clothes,
a ghost with no footsteps, just a trail of “almost.”
Then the best part – you write again with that tone,
“I wanna get to know you, be part of your home.”
Same letter, same breath, like a punchline you chose:
“I’m moving six hundred kilometers up, North Sea coast.”

(Hook)
You can’t be close but far away,
hacked into my system to this day.
You can’t be close but far away,
disconnected from myself, cast astray.
You can’t be close but far away,
hacked into my system to this day.
You can’t be close but far away,
look what you did to me, but anyway...

(Verse)
So I wrote back – don’t recall every sentence I threw,
but I remember the point, yeah, I gave you the truth:
“You’re a stranger to me, this won’t work, that’s facts,
you don’t get both worlds, you don’t get both tracks.”
Then you ghosted again, like it’s your only talent –
twenty-five years, nothing, no call, no balance.
Left me three vinyls I never even spun,
and a lifetime of fire I don’t know where it’s from.

(Verse)
I swore I’d never be you, so I built the reverse,
made a home out of showing up, broke the family curse.
I was there. I was steady. I stayed in the room.
Didn’t weaponize silence, didn’t make love a “soon.”
But here’s the sick twist that I never could dodge –
even doing it right, I was still in your fog.
‘Cause I spent so much fuel just to not be your type,
I forgot what I wanted when it wasn’t a fight.
I built a whole self like a rebuttal to you,
made a life as a headline: “Look what I didn’t do.”
Now I’m haunting my days, like I’m watching, not living,
hands full of proof, still can’t feel what I’m giving.

(Hook)
You can’t be close but far away,
hacked into my system to this day.
You can’t be close but far away,
disconnected from myself, cast astray.
You can’t be close but far away,
hacked into my system to this day.
You can’t be close but far away,
look what you did to me, but anyway...

(Bridge)
Fuck you for leaving. Fuck you for showing up halfway.
Fuck you for the mixed signals, the games, the delay.
Fuck you for the vinyls like they’d translate your case,
like a song could replace what you wouldn’t face.
Fuck you for the letters dressed up like repair,
for thinking words are a substitute for being there.
Fuck you for the math: “I’m near, but I’m gone.”
That contradiction is the button my head sticks on.

(Hook)
You can’t be close but far away,
hacked into my system to this day.
You can’t be close but far away,
disconnected from myself, cast astray.
You can’t be close but far away,
look what you did to me, but anyway...
